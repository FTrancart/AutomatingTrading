Get asset pairs data from Binance API and store it in sqlite tables. Create/cancel order from API key.

Fill API_KEY and API_SECRET with your Binance API key information to execute a new order or cancel it from the python file.
You do not need the API key authentification to execute the rest of the functions as it only reads data and writes it in sqlite tables.
